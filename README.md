# apple-music-playlist-ranker

**Simple website to rank songs in an Apple Music playlist using the Elo rating system**

The `assets\js\apple-music-wrapper.js` file contains the code that is used inside a browser console to extract basic information about a playlist in JSON format. 

After executed, the JSON code is sent to the clipboard and the user should store it in a JSON file such as the example file in `assets\data\weekndInfo.json`.

As a simple project made for fun, this (currently?) does not have a back-end attached in order to store the results of the votes made. An example of the voting page can be seen below:
